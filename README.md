# GRE Argot Tester
**by Curtis Yungen**

August 2019

The GRE Argot Tester (obviously named for the acronym) is a simple web application I created to help my girlfriend study for the GRE. The program tests the user on 500 of the most common words seen on the GRE. 

A user may:
* Set an image and sentence for each word to aid in memorization and understanding.
* View hints that include the word type and definition.
* Listen to the word's pronunciation.
* Select groups of words (units) for more focused practice.
* Review words answered correctly and incorrectly after each round of testing.

**Check out the project here:** https://vocab-cjy.herokuapp.com.
